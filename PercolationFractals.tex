\section{Percolation Fractals}
Percolated fractals will be the main object we intend to study.

We will begin with the definition of the percolation process in the 2D case, as it will be our main interest (it is also the most intuitive case, as easy to picture).

\subsection{Blob}
To have a better understanding, we begin by studying the central "blob" of the fractal.
